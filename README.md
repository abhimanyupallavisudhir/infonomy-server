## To-do
### central to the design
- [ ] make sure recursive decision contexts are only visible to bots, sellers who provided original, buyer who's already bought the inspected decision contexts

### simplificatons made
- [ ] `inspect_task` inspects *all* info offers -- we might want some way to select specific InfoOffers to inspect, ideally via some google ads kinda thing
- [ ] maybe let people other than original buyer also buy info offers
- [ ] let user customize how many infooffers child llm should wait for

### important development
- [ ] pre-populate with buyers and sellers
- [ ] better flexibility in choosing LLM agents
- [ ] browser extension
- [ ] UI (maybe Q&A like UI)
- [ ] metaculus bot
